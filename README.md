<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Carsten</h1>

I have spent most of my career working on large-scale systems where the term full-stack developer does not make sense. Hence, I do not consider myself a full-stack developer. I prefer the term 360-degree Developer coined at the GOTO Copenhagen conference in 2017. A 360-degree developer masters all aspects of delivering quality software ranging from initial discussion over specification to development and test and further on to devops and support.

My current interests evolve around Julia, GoLang, gRPC, and algorithms for generating subsets. Learning new programming languages tends to improve ones understanding of programming in general and puts your "native" languages in perspective.

I experiment a lot so please do not think of my repositories as production-ready code.
